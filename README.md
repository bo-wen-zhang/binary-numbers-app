# Binary Numbers App

## What is this?

A web app aimed to teach the user about binary number representation. \
Also a chance for me to practise HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. \

## React

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
